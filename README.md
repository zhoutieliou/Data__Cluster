# Data__Cluster\n
#we use two data set.\n
#GN-network is a set with 128 node and is devided into four groups, {1-32},{33-64},{64-96},{97-128}.\n
#karate set has 34 set and is supposed to divide into two groups, my answer is {5,6,7,11,17} and the other belong to group2.\n
#.sif is convient for Cytoscape to read.\n
#Answer.txt is the answer for GN-network, Answer_karate.txt for the karate set.\n
#G.cys and G_karate.cys are the results of Cytoscape.\n
#you can see clearly the result of clustering from the picture karate.sif.png, karate.sif2.png for another pattern for the same result.
